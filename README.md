# Intro_to_Backend
Learning Python App Engine Standard Environment

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Google Cloud SDK
Cloud Tools for PowerShell
Python 2.7

## Running the tests

1. Clone the app repository to your local machine

2. Then go to the directory that contains the sample code

3. Test the application using the local development server (dev_appserver.py), which is included with the SDK.

4. From within the directory where the app's app.yaml configuration file is located, start the local development server with the following command:

```
dev_appserver.py app.yaml
```

The local development server is now running and listening for requests on port 8080

5. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser to view the app.
